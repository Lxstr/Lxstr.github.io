							<!-- <div class="meta mb-1"><span class="date">Published 2 days ago</span><span class="time">5 min read</span><span class="comment"><a href="#">8 comments</a></span></div> -->
							<div class="intro">In 2016 I decided to
								put together an iOS application to automate fuel planning for the AP3C, which was the
								aircraft I was flying as a pilot. It was a legacy aircraft where the fuel planning was
								still done with various lookup charts and tables, sometimes different versions of the
								same thing. I found I could save many minutes per day and even reduce the likelihood of
								error by translating the tables into equations with python and then creating a swift
								algorithm for use by the app. I enjoyed both the programming side and creating a
								user interface that made the process as rapid as possible and error safe.
								<br><br>
								This helped me I realise I would enjoy being part of teams that can help automate work
								processes and make life easier for people. I am also fascinated by the area of
								cryptography and the possible applications for security and data integrity. My dream
								would be to help build a product with an invested and passionate user base where I could
								be a conduit between operators, engineers and developers.

							<div class="intro">I chose to study at RMIT because it has an excellent world-wide
								reputation in engineering and technology and I believe it can provide opportunities to
								build a strong foundation of skills for my future career. RMIT also seems to collaborate
								and share subjects with other universities, which makes a possible degree switch easier
								and offers broader experiences within one degree.
								<br><br>
								I hope to learn technical programming skills that can be applied in many different
								languages or frameworks that I might learn in the future. I would like to explore
								different kinds of collaboration and teamwork
								management that can make the most of all talents and give me more future career
								leadership opportunities. Also, I hope to have a broad range of knowledge that might
								help me to better understand IT colleagues who are outside of whatever technical
								area I choose to specialise in.

							<div class="meta mb-1"><span class="comment"><a
										href="https://aglive.com/company/careers/">Job Posting</a></span></div>
							<div class="intro">AGLive a blockchain company that is working on improving traceability and
								authentication of food chains. This genuine bringing of value to businesses and
								consumers inspires me.
								<br><br>
								The purpose of the role is to manage the direction, testing and development of the
								product towards
								improved
								outcomes for the stakeholders involved and balance their competing needs. For the
								company this might mean profitability, scalability and marketability. For the end users
								this might be various considerations such as ease of use, security and value added.
								<br><br>
								What appeals to me is the wide range of influence from this role. For example, the
								advertisement lists 5 different main areas of responsibility. For example,
								number 3 (Market research and A/B testing, analysis, etc) would require process
								knowledge, technical knowledge and creativity.
								<br><br>
								This seems to be leadership position that calls on a good foundation of technical
								skills (so that the product and what is possible can be understood) along with skills
								for strong collaboration and informed decision making.

							<div class="intro">

								Required skills:
								<ul>
									<li>Two years experience in product management of integrated
										software/hardware/service products</li>
									<li>Knowledge of blockchain technology and experience with data analysis software
									</li>
									<li>Independently motivated ‘team-player’ character who has worked in a startup or
										similar environment an is capable of uniting people and progressing the product
									</li>
								</ul>
								I currently have skills in highly motivated technical team environments for 8.5 years
								Air Force experience as a pilot. I have some knowledge of basic blockchain technology
								and unrelated coding languages (python, javascript, swift).
								<br><br>
								I will focus on developing the technical knowledge and team skills required for building
								IT products through this subject a future Bachelor of IT or Information Systems
								subjects. I also will take subjects that give more direct product management skills such
								as technical requirements, A/B testing, data analysis and competitive analysis. I would
								also like to take subjects that allow me to gain more knowledge of the business side of
								this job, at this stage I suspect this might include some marketing and business
								strategy content.
								<br><br>
								For my graduate jobs and internships I would like to work as a developer in small
								programming companies so that I can get more exposure to product management and
								progressively take on more product management responsibilities under mentorship.

									I think it is always helpful to reflect on personality traits, not to take them as
									gospel, but to consider my own behaviour more closely and how I might differ to
									other
									people. To know that other people hold different priorities and talents such as the
									Myers-briggs types described well in 16personalities.com. However, I think there is
									always a degree of bias in my own results. I likely under emphasis my sociability
									but I
									would like a friend or colleague to take the test on my behalf and compare the
									results.
									<br>

									<br>
									My visual and tactile learning styles suggest I should try to collaborate as much as
									possible with tools such as screen sharing and video conferencing and working
									together
									on items.
									<br>
									<br>
									My Myers-briggs results suggest, as weaknesses, a tendency to be withdrawn or
									second-guess themselves. The energy of the diplomat (NF) types and the organisation
									of
									the sentinel (SJ) types might compensate for this, so a balanced group is important
									and
									also my own awareness of this. The results also support my confidence that I will
									add
									creative analysis and technical problem solving capacity to the team.

							<!-- <div class="meta mb-1"><span class="date">Published 3 months ago</span><span class="time">2
									min read</span><span class="comment"><a href="#">1 comment</a></span></div> -->
							<div class="intro">
								The project will be a iOS or ionic (cross platform) app that allows the user to
								automatically convert a series of tick boxes (that they can define) into sentences.
								<br><br>
								I have heard from a psychologist who regularly needs to write reports on the appearance
								and mannerisms of a patient which are very repetitive and follow the same structure each
								time. I suspect that there are other professions that have similar report writing needs
								and would be willing to pay for the time savings this software could give.
								<br><br>
								The features required are:
								<ul>
									<li>A templating page for setting up the tickboxes. This includes typing in the
										leading text
										for each series of tick boxes and the
										names for each tick boxes. It should also allow you to save the template.</li>
									<li>A page that allows the user to tick the relevant boxes in a easy to use format
										and clear the selections when done</li>
									<li>A popup or page where the output text is displayed and the user can share or
										export the
										text quickly to add elsewhere</li>
									<li>An open and save button with associated save data storage</li>
								</ul>
								In one option, we would use a cross platform programming tool such as <a
									href="https://ionic.io/build">ionic</a> or <a href="https://flutter.dev">flutter</a>
								that can run
								on all platforms. The second preference would be to use iOS programming and run it only
								on Mac, iPad and iOS. The amount of previous experience with this software would be a
								major factor in the groups choice. In both instances, we would collaborate on GitHub.
								<br><br>
								Programming skills for development and testing are the main requirement but other skills
								will allow the app to take
								form more effectively. Prototyping and user outreach may prevent unnecessary code
								changes and provide an initial deliverable. Design and presentation skills could help
								create awareness of the product and
								advertise it well on a website and the various app stores. In addition, coordination
								skills will greatly increase the efficiency of work. These skills are quite feasible
								within our group and a reasonable deliverable would be a detailed specification and
								prototype in Invision Studio or
								Sketch. However, an application may be possible.
								<br><br>
								The biggest obstacle is likely going to be having to learn app development skills and
								potentially having multiple people spending there time on this rather that actually
								producing a product or deliverable.
								<br><br>
								A successful app would allow many professionals to save work hours at a small cost and
								would help improve the world.
