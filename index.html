							<div class="intro">
								<p>
									In 2016 I decided to
									put together an iOS application to automate fuel planning for the AP3C, which was
									the
									aircraft I was flying as a pilot. It was a legacy aircraft where the fuel planning
									was
									still done with various lookup charts and tables, sometimes different versions of
									the
									same thing. I found I could save many minutes per day and even reduce the likelihood
									of
									error by translating the tables into equations with python and then creating a swift
									algorithm for use by the app. I enjoyed both the programming side and creating a
									user interface that made the process as rapid as possible and error safe.
								</p>
								<p>

									This helped me I realise I would enjoy being part of teams that can help automate
									work
									processes and make life easier for people. I am also fascinated by the area of
									cryptography and the possible applications for security and data integrity. My dream
									would be to help build a product with an invested and passionate user base where I
									could
									be a conduit between operators, engineers and developers.

							<div class="intro">
								<p>
									I chose to study at RMIT because it has an excellent world-wide
									reputation in engineering and technology and I believe it can provide opportunities
									to
									build a strong foundation of skills for my future career. RMIT also seems to
									collaborate
									and share subjects with other universities, which makes a possible degree switch
									easier
									and offers broader experiences within one degree.
								</p>
								<p>
									I hope to learn technical programming skills that can be applied in many different
									languages or frameworks that I might learn in the future. I would like to explore
									different kinds of collaboration and teamwork
									management that can make the most of all talents and give me more future career
									leadership opportunities. Also, I hope to have a broad range of knowledge that might
									help me to better understand IT colleagues who are outside of whatever technical
									area I choose to specialise in.

										href="https://aglive.com/company/careers/">Job Posting</a></span></div>
							<div class="intro">
								<p>
									AGLive a blockchain company that is working on improving traceability and
									authentication of food chains (AGLive 2020). This genuine bringing of value to
									businesses and
									consumers inspires me.
								</p>
								<p>
									The purpose of the role is to manage the direction, testing and development of the
									product towards
									improved
									outcomes for the stakeholders involved and balance their competing needs. For the
									company this might mean profitability, scalability and marketability. For the end
									users
									this might be various considerations such as ease of use, security and value added.
								</p>
								<p>
									What appeals to me is the wide range of influence from this role. For example, the
									advertisement lists 5 different main areas of responsibility. For example,
									number 3 (Market research and A/B testing, analysis, etc) would require process
									knowledge, technical knowledge and creativity.
								</p>
								<p>
									This seems to be leadership position that calls on a good foundation of technical
									skills (so that the product and what is possible can be understood) along with
									skills
									for strong collaboration and informed decision making.

								<p>
									Required skills interpreted from job description (AGLive 2020):
									<ul>
										<li>Two years of experience in product management of integrated
											software/hardware/service products</li>
										<li>Knowledge of blockchain technology and experience with data analysis
											software
										</li>
										<li>Independently motivated ‘team-player’ character who has worked in a startup

										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									I currently have skills in highly motivated technical team environments for 8.5
									years Air Force experience as a pilot. I have some knowledge of basic blockchain

								</p>
								<p>
									I will focus on developing the technical knowledge and team skills required for
									building
									IT products through this subject a future Bachelor of IT or Information Systems
									subjects. I also will take subjects that give more direct product management skills
									such
									as technical requirements, A/B testing, data analysis and competitive analysis. I
									would
									also like to take subjects that allow me to gain more knowledge of the business side
									of
									this job, at this stage I suspect this might include some marketing and business
									strategy content.
								</p>
								<p>
									For my graduate jobs and internships, I would like to work as a developer in small
									programming companies so that I can get more exposure to product management and
									progressively take on more product management responsibilities under mentorship.

									I think it is always helpful to reflect on personality traits, not to take them as
									gospel, but to consider my own behaviour more closely and how I might differ to
									other
									people. To know that other people hold different priorities and talents such as the
									Myers-Briggs types described well in 16personalities.com (16Personalities 2020).
									However, I think there is
									always a degree of bias in my own results. I likely under emphasis my sociability
									but I
									would like a friend or colleague to take the test on my behalf and compare the
									results.
								</p>
								<p>

									My visual and tactile learning styles suggest I should try to collaborate as much as
									possible with tools such as screen sharing and video conferencing and working
									together
									on items. My creative style results suggests I should try to incorporate some amount of creativity into my work for the sake of my own happiness.
								</p>
								<p>
									My Myers-Briggs results suggest, as weaknesses, a tendency to be withdrawn or
									second-guess themselves. The energy of the diplomat (NF) types and the organisation
									of
									the sentinel (SJ) types might compensate for this, so a balanced group is important
									and
									also my own awareness of this. The results also support my confidence that I will
									add
									creative analysis and technical problem-solving capacity to the team.

							<div class="intro">
								<h6>Overview</h6>
								<p>A multi-platform software product that will output full sentences based on the
									selections of a user-defined tick-box form. The user will then be able to save the
									results and copy/paste or share the output text for use where needed.</p>

								<h6>Motivation</h6>
								<p>Health professionals, particularly psychologists and physiotherapists, write reports
									on the symptoms, appearance and mannerisms of a patient which are follow the same
									structure each time and result in many hours of wasted writing time that could
									otherwise be spend with patients. They often have to repeat sentences such as -
									<em>The
										patient’s knee was extremely painful or extension and walking. The patient had
										70%
										range of motion. The patient looked tired and had low energy.
									</em> There are no easily accessible products that can do this. There are over 25
									000 members of The APS (The Australian Psychological Society 2020) and 29 000
									members of The APA (The Australian Physiotherapy Association 2020).
								</p>
								<h6>Description</h6>
								<p>
									The app will be a basic three-page application that consists of:
									<ul>
										<li>
											A page where a user can set up the tick-boxes and the sentences to go with
											them.
											This means typing in the leading text for each series of tick boxes and the
											names
											for each tick boxes. It will also allow you to save the template or open
											others.

										</li>
										<li>
											A page that allows the user to tick the relevant boxes in an easy to use
											format
											and
											clear the tick-boxes when done.
										</li>
										<li>
											A popup or page where the output text is displayed and the user can save,
											share
											or
											export the text quickly to add elsewhere.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

										title="Figure 8" style="width:50%">
									<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><b>Figure 8: </b><em>Run anywhere</em> by Ionic, n.d.
									</figcaption>
								</figure>

								<p>
									Being able to save different templates or output sentences would be a second
									landmark feature in the development process as it would be highly desirable for a
									user but not essential, as long as they can easily export results in the meantime.
								</p>
								<h6>Tools</h6>
								<p>
									The ideal tool for developing this would be the cross-platform programming system
									Ionic
									(Ionic 2020), which leverages HTML and Javascript web technologies, making it
									adaptable
									and quicker to learn. If it is not possible to learn Ionic in a short enough time,
									the
									second preference would be to use Xcode programming and release it only on Mac (Mac
									Catalyst, Apple 2020), iPad and iOS. Git would be used for version control.
								</p>
								<figure class="figure text-center">

										class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Image of different devices"
										title="Figure 8" style="width:50%">
									<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><b>Figure 9: </b><em>Pre-design UI Components</em>
										by Ionic, n.d.</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>
									The user will need an android, macOS, iOS or iPadOS running system with up-to-date
									software.
								</p>



								<h6>Skills and Feasibility</h6>
								<p>
									Programming skills for development and testing are the main requirement but other
									skills will allow the app to take form more effectively. Prototyping and user
									outreach may prevent unnecessary code changes and provide an initial deliverable.
									Design and presentation skills could help create awareness of the product and
									advertise it well on a website and the various app stores. The biggest obstacle is
									likely going to be having to learn app development skills and potentially spending
									time on this rather that actually producing a product or alternative deliverable. Although this would be very easy to access, given the number free or cheap online courses for Ionic development (Ionic Academy 2020). Therefore, learning this is quite possible in less than 10 hours. Also, there would be no need for external database usage in the Minimum Viable Product, the state and saved templates could be kept on the user's device.
								</p>
								<h6>Outcome</h6>
								<p>
									A successful app would allow many professionals to save work hours at a small cost
									and
									would help improve the world. For example, psychologists would be able to quickly
									record
									the manner of the patient and focus on the main purpose of the appointment.
									However,
									even a prototype, customer engagement and specification would allow development to
									continue at a later time if it is found to be viable.
